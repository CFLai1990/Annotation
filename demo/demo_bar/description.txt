This image shows the global sales of three top-selling mobile phone brands in the last five years.
We can see that X Company has always been the best-selling brand. In 2013, the sales of X Company reached 450 million, which were almost three times as much as the sales of Y Company. Even in the worst year, the sales of X Company still remained above 300 million.
As the second-ranked brand, Y Company's sales rose steadily from 2013 to 2015. But after 2015, the sales of Y Company were basically stable between 200 million and 250 million.
Z Company, on the other hand, shows a rapidly growing trend in the last five years. The sales of Z Company in 2017 were almost as good as the sales of Y Company in 2013. It suggests that Z Company may become a strong competitor to Y Company in the mobile phone market in the near future.
