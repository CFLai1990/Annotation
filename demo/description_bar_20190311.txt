This image shows the global sales of three top-selling mobile phone brands in the last five years.
We can see that Samsung has always been the best-selling brand. In 2013, the sales of Samsung reached 450 million, which were almost three times as much as the sales of Apple. Even in the worst year, the sales of Samsung still remained above 300 million.
As the second-ranked brand, Apple's sales rose steadily from 2013 to 2015. But after 2015, the sales of Apple were basically stable between 200 million and 250 million.
Huawei, on the other hand, shows a rapidly growing trend in the last five years. The sales of Huawei in 2017 were almost as good as the sales of Apple in 2013. It suggests that Huawei may become a strong competitor to Apple in the mobile phone market in the near future.
